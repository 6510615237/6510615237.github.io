Hello, my name is Plowit Wongsoontorn. I was born at chanthaburi
but risen at Nakhonsawan. My favorite hobbies are cooking food 
and playing computer. Now I am studying at Thamasat University.
I have learn many things at this place such as how to live alone
without family, how to make yourself have more responsibility
,and of clause, learning about computer engineering, the faculty that
I am studying in. For conclusion I thinks that I still have many other
things to learn at this University and I will love this place much more.
